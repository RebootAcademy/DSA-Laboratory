1) Write a program to reverse a positive integer in decimal form using a recursive function.

Input: number in the range of 0 – 2
31
Output: reverse of the number

Example

Input:

Enter the value of number
155
Output:
551

Input:

Enter the value of number
1234567895

Output:
5987654321


2) Given two strings, say s1 and s2, consisting of letters from the English alphabet only [a-zA-Z].
Write a program to check whether s2 is a substring of s1. If yes, print the starting indices
of s2 in s1.
Note: String index should start from 0 and the strings are case-sensitive.

Input: Two strings s1 and s2
Output: Starting index of substring in s1

Example

Input:
Enter string s1
abababab
Enter string s2
aba
Output:
Yes
0
2
4

Input:
Enter string s1
abababab
Enter string s2
abb
Output:
No


3) Write a program to create a union with the following members.
Name, Age, Id-number
Id-number is of type union with the following fields:
Aadhaar-Number: long long int
Voters-ID: String of 7 characters consisting of uppercase letters and decimal digits [0-
9A-Z]
The program should read the Name and Age of a person. If the age is less than 18, the
program should ask for the Aadhaar-Number and store it in the union. Otherwise the
program should ask for the Voters-ID and store it in the union. After reading the input,
your program should print the Name, Age, Id-Number of the person.

Input : Name, Age, Aadhaar-Number/Voters-ID
Output : Name, Age, Id-Number

Example

Input:
Enter name:
Krithika
Enter age:
25
Enter Voter- ID:
ABR1286

Output:
Krithika, 25, ABR1286

Input:
Enter name:
Aysha
Enter age:
14

Enter Aadhaar-Number:
876054189623

Output:
Aysha, 14, 876054189623

4) Write a program to calculate area and perimeter of a rectangle using two functions. The
program should ask for a choice and based on the choice, corresponding function should
be called using a function pointer.

Input:
Enter Length:
12
Enter Breadth:
8
Menu:
1. Area
2. Perimeter
3. Exit
Enter the choice:

2. Perimeter
3. Exit
Enter the choice:
3


5) Write a program to check whether a given matrix is a magic square or not.
Input: A square matrix of size 'n'
Output: “Yes” or “No”

Name, Roll number, Branch, Marks of 5 subjects.
 Your program should allow the user to perform the following operations.
1) Append student record into the file
2) Display all the records in the file (Output should be as per the format given in
sample input & output, case 3)
3) Count the number of records in the file
4) Calculate and print average total-marks in the console
